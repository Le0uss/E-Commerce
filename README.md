# E-Commerce Project

## Introduction
I embarked on a project to create an innovative e-commerce website focusing on wearable technology. This solo venture was inspired by the belief that wearable tech represents the future of consumer electronics.

## Project Planning
Initially, I dedicated time to meticulously plan the project:
- Designing the website's aesthetics and user interface.
- Defining the site's functionalities and user experience.
- Outlining the key features and potential stretch goals.

## Development Process

### Frontend Development
- Built a dynamic user interface where customers can view and purchase wearable tech.
- Implemented a persistent shopping cart using database integration, avoiding `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`.
- Allowed users to edit their cart before checkout, applying a reducer for state management.

### Backend Development
- Developed a RESTful Node server, ensuring efficient data handling and server-client communication.
- Set up MongoDB for database management, ensuring real-time updates as users make purchases.

### Code Quality
- Maintained a high standard of code quality with clear comments and organized file structure.
- Focused on minimizing bugs and refining the codebase for optimal performance.

## Collaborative Tools
- Utilized Trello for task management and tracking project progress.
- Established a dedicated communication channel for consistent updates and discussions.

## Stretch Goals and Additional Features
- Aimed to exceed the minimal viable product (MVP) requirements by incorporating additional libraries to enhance user experience.
- Explored and integrated various tools and technologies beyond the core requirements to add innovative features to the website.

## Conclusion
This E-Commerce project not only showcases my technical skills in frontend and backend development but also my ability to independently manage and execute a complex project, delivering a sophisticated and user-friendly e-commerce platform.
